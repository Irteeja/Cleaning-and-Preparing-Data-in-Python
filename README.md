# Cleaning-and-Preparing-Data-in-Python
Perform data cleaning on a real-world data set of artworks contained in the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA).
# MoMA Data Cleaning Project
This project focuses on cleaning a dataset from MoMA (Museum of Modern Art). The original dataset was found to be "dirty," meaning that it contained various inconsistencies, errors, and formatting issues that made it difficult to use for analysis or visualization.

# Data Cleaning Process
To clean the MoMA dataset, Python was used as the programming language, along with the csv and re modules. The cleaning process involved the following steps:

1.Importing the dataset into Python using the csv module.
2.Examining the dataset to identify inconsistencies and errors.
3.Removing unnecessary columns from the dataset.
4.Cleaning up inconsistent date formats by averaging and rounding dates and converting them to integers.
5.Removing unnecessary characters from artist and title names using regular expressions.
6.Exporting the cleaned dataset as a new CSV file.
# Project Results
After the cleaning process was completed, a new CSV file containing the cleaned MoMA dataset was created and saved to the local computer. The new dataset is now more consistent, easier to use, and can be used for further analysis and visualization.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you can clone the repository to your local computer and run the Python script. Make sure you have Python and the required modules installed.
